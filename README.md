# Nativity
A super framework of UI components built with an aim to enhance the native app development speed and experience.

## 1. Why Nativity?
There are numerous choices to develop a mobile app, primarily the native, cross compiled and hybrid paths.
The aim of frameworks/SDKs that build cross compiled apps or Hybrid frameworks are to improve the development speed and target platforms like iOS and Android through a single code base.

However, these frameworks/SDKs takeaway the experience and joy, programmers get when extending the standard iOS/Android SDKs to achieve what they need.
Frameworks/SDKs that build cross compiled apps do their bit of providing a better solution by compiling a native app, while allowing programmers to use one code for all the platforms. Hybrid apps are improving in their performance and overall look and feel, each day. But the way a native app runs has always been admired. 

Native app development process on the other hand, requires developers to be familiar with respective SDK's, IDE's, interface guidelines, tricks and limitations. In addition, customising the SDK provided components for example, modifying textfields to accept specific characters, appear differently , etc., needs few extra lines of code.

The Nativity framework, addresses these aspects. It will offer multiple variants of generally used and advanced UI components that would need few lines of code to be integrated into a native application.

## 2. What Nativity does?
Nativity framework will hold variety of UI components, new and extensions of UIKit components. This will help native app programmers to include such components in their apps without building it on their own, thus saving time. This framework is built on the BoxKit framework that would help position and animate UI components easily even when not using Storyboards or XIB files in case of iOS.

## Rules
1. Use Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android
